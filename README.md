# DeFi-Wallet-Risk-Scoring-Compound-Protocol-V2-V3-
This project builds a risk scoring model for Ethereum wallets interacting with the Compound V2/V3 DeFi lending protocols. It analyzes historical borrowing, repaying, and liquidation events using data from the Covalent API, and outputs a normalized risk score and level for each wallet.
